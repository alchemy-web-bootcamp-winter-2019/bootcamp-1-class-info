Create the following structure inside your `~/projects` directory (folder). You will need to have a team member from the opposite team teach you how to do the thing you didn't know!

```
projects
  |
  +- my-app
      |
      +- pets
      |    |
      |    +- cat.txt  "garfield duchess sylvestor"
      |    |
      |    +- dog.text "lassie snoopy pluto"
      |    |
      |    +- food
      |        |
      |        +- cat-food.txt  "tuna mouse chicken"
      |        |
      |        +- dog-food.txt "beef lamb chicken"
      |
      + test
          |
          +- cat.test.txt   "meow meow meow"
          |
          +- dog.test.txt   "woof woof woof"
```
