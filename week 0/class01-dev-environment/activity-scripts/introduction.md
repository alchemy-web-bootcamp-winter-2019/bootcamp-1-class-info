## Compare to GUI

Setup side-by-side Terminal and Finder/GUI


### Compare and Contrast!

Where am I?

```sh
> pwd
```

What is home directory (`~`)?

Lost? Go Home:

```sh
> cd
```

What's in this directory?

```sh
> ls
```

### Setup for Team Exercise

Using your GUI, create a `projects` directory (folder) in your home directory.

### Cleaning up

Visually clear out commands:

```sh
> clear
```
